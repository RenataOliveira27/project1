    <!--I usually like to make a container div for each section of my page
    lets make this like the greeting section or something-->

    <!--start the page with its title in maybe a jumbotron-->
    
    
    <!--below that lets make search button with either a menu that is initially hidden
     This menu will contain the sites we want to run our query through and a checkbox. an extra box that check "all" would be cool-->
    
    
    <!--There should be some sort of visual division from this top section like a line-->
    
    <!--this next section is the actual comparison section and should have a div-->
    
    <!--initially we should have a greeting message here describing how the site works and how we want users to use it-->
   
    <!--the cards will be dynamically created and placed here so i dont think we need to do anything more with this section in the html-->
    <!--another visual divider-->
    
    <!--This section containes our bootstrap carosel. it should display lets say three different examples of 
    cool queries we can make. so im thinking we do one slide for each of our interests
    for instance I would like my slide to show three examples of the query "election" from Fox CNN and NYT
    The style of these examples shoudl match what the users search results look like-->
    
    <!--at the bottom of the page I think a ticker would be cool I would like to display the top 5 trending tweets
    maybe some stock info? idk whatever we feel like. it might not even be necessary-->
    <!--the final thing we want to do is hide an easter egg in this file somewhere for our snake game-->
